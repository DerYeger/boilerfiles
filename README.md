# BoilerFiles

> A CLI for downloading your boilerplate files from a public GitHub template repo.

## Features

Are you tired of copying your `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc` to every new project you create?
So am I!

With this CLI, you can easily download (multiple) files from your public GitHub repositories.

You may also create a file `.boilerfiles` in your home directory containing a qualifier for a default repository, e.g., `YourUsername/YourTemplateRepository`.
